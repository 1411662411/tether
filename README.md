[Tether](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) is a small, focused JavaScript library for defining and managing the position of user interface (UI) elements in relation to one another on a web page. It is a tool for web developers building features that require certain UI elements to be precisely positioned based on the location of another UI element.

There are often situations in UI development where elements need to be attached to other elements, but placing them right next to each other in the [DOM tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model) can be problematic based on the context. For example, what happens if the element weâ€™re attaching other elements to is fixed to the center of the screen? Or what if the element is inside a scrollable container? How can we prevent the attached element from being clipped as it disappears from view while a user is scrolling? Tether can solve all of these problems and more.

Some common UI elements that have been built with Tether are [tooltips](http://github.hubspot.com/tooltip/docs/welcome), [select menus](http://github.hubspot.com/select/docs/welcome), [dropdown menus](http://github.hubspot.com/drop/docs/welcome), and [guided tours](http://github.hubspot.com/shepherd/docs/welcome). Tether is flexible and can be used to [solve](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/out-of-bounds/) [all](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/content-visible) [kinds](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/element-scroll) [of](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/enable-disable) [interesting]() [problems](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/examples/viewport); it ensures UI elements stay where they need to be, based on the various user interactions (click, scroll, etc) and layout contexts (fixed positioning, inside scrollable containers, etc).

Please have a look at the [documentation](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for a more detailed explanation of why you might need Tether for your next project.

##What to Use Tether for and When to Use It

For those who might be new to JavaScript libraries, a library is simply a JavaScript file (or files) that contain useful JavaScript code to help achieve tasks easier and faster.  Since Tether is a JavaScript **UI** (User Interface) library it contains several pieces of useful code to help you to manage the way your website or web app appears.

Tether's goal to is to help you position your elements side-by-side when needed. 

###When to Use It

Let's say you've built yourself your dream project, that fancy web app that's sure to become the next big thing! 

An important feature of your new app is to allow users to comment on shared photos. However, due to limited vertical space and the overall layout of your new app, you'd like to display the comments **next** to the image, similar to Instagram's layout.

Your HTML code might look something like this:

```
<div class="container">
	...
	<img src="my_awesome_pic" alt="cool-pic" class="element"/>
	<div class="comment_box">
		...
		...
		...
	</div>
	...
</div>
```
Now, you could achieve this with some CSS using it's `position` property, but going this route can be a pain considering many of `position`'s values actually take elements **out** of their natural DOM flow, ie if you have an element at the bottom of your HTML document, using `position: absolute` or `position: fixed` might actually move it all the way to the top of your website in the browser.

Not only that, but you're left to make all the proper adjustments to make sure **other** elements aren't negatively affected also. Not to mention, you'll want your comment box to be **responsive**. Which coding manually is a challenge all on it's own.

###Here's how to properly position your elements with Tether:

After downloading or `cloning` the repo and including the `tether.js` (in `/src/`) in your HTML file:

1. In your JavaScript file, create a `new` instance of the `Tether` object (or constructor function for those a bit more advanced) :
```
new Tether({});
```

2. Within the `{}` (curly braces) enter your preferences. Tether's extensive list of options can be found here in the [Tether documentation] (http://github.hubspot.com/tether/)
```
new Tether({
	element: comment_box,
	target: my_awesome_pic,
	attachment: 'top right'
	targetAttachment: 'top left'
});
```

Now you have a perfectly placed comment section to go with your awesome pic! It'll even stay attached to the element when a user resizes their browser window.

There are tons of other useful features of Tether as well, instead of "comment boxes" you could also build:

* Tooltips for useful hints and tricks
* Dropdown menus
* Autocomplete popups for forms
* and other endless and creative possibilities
